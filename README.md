## Phone book

Take your solution from the previous homework and add the storage of the
phonebook contacts to localStorage. Use lifecycle methods.

- When adding and deleting a contact, the contacts are saved to the local
  storage.
- When the app is loaded, contacts, if any, are read from local storage and
  written to the state.
